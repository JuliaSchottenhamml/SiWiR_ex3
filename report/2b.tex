\section{Task 2b} 

As from 2a we have,

${T_{tot}}$ = $\frac{\alpha}{k} + \frac{X (k-1)}{2} + \frac{1}{\beta}$

To get the best value of k we have to take the differentiation of above equation and equate to 0.

    $\frac{dT_{tot}}{dk}$ = -$\frac{\alpha}{{k}^{2}} +\frac{X}{2}$ = 0

As $k \geq 0,  k = \sqrt{\frac{2\alpha}{X}}$

So putting $\alpha$ = 2 ms, X = 0.2 ms here,  k = $\sqrt{\frac{4}{0.2}} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.472$

Let's take k = 5, 
${T_{tot}}$ = $\frac{2}{5} + \frac{0.2 \times 4}{2}  + \frac{1}{30}$ \newline
$=0.4 + 0.4 + -.0333 \approx 0.833 ms.$ \newline

So Answer is best value of k = 5, and ${T_{tot}} = 0.833 ms . $
